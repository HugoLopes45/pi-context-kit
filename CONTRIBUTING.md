# Contributing

Small, focused contributions are welcome. Discuss large behavior changes in an issue before implementing them.

## Local checks

Use Node.js 22.19 or later. CI checks Node 22 and 24.

```bash
npm ci
npm run check
```

`npm run check` validates package and lockfile metadata, release notes, TypeScript, and the offline tests. The tests use Pi's faux provider, not a real model.

CI also installs the latest published Pi packages on Node 24 and reruns these checks. It runs weekly, even without repository changes.
Keep the lockfile baseline reproducible; do not replace it with an unbounded dependency tree. Host-provided peer dependencies stay `*`.

For an optional manual test in Pi:

```bash
pi -e .
```

Do not load another copy of this extension in the same session.

## Changes

- Keep the extension independent of personal paths, prompts, and other extensions.
- Preserve unrelated user instructions and session content.
- Prefer existing Pi APIs and small changes over new dependencies or abstractions.
- Add a regression test for a bug and check that it fails before the fix.
- Do not weaken tests or input validation to pass checks.
- Describe user-visible changes under `Unreleased` in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Never include credentials, account data, or private conversation content in commits, screenshots, or logs.

## Pull requests

Open a branch or fork, then submit a pull request against `main`.

Explain the problem, the minimal fix, and the checks you ran. Keep unrelated changes in separate pull requests.

`main` requires a pull request and successful `Check (Node 22)` and `Check (Node 24)` checks against the current base.
No third-party approval is required, so a solo maintainer can merge after CI succeeds. Force pushes and branch deletion are blocked.

## Releases

Release preparation requires Node 24 or later, npm publish permission through the configured workflow, and an authenticated GitHub CLI.

Follow the [release procedure](README.md#contributing-and-releases). Do not bump the package version in ordinary contribution pull requests.

Merging a release PR only prepares the version. The PR must update both manifests and include nonempty versioned release notes. CI rejects version rollback.

Only the repository owner can launch **Publish release** from an explicit `vX.Y.Z` tag whose commit belongs to `main`. The owner must also approve the `npm` environment deployment. Pushes and tag creation do not publish.

Retry a failed release from its original Actions run and tag. Do not move any release tag or reuse its version for different code.
If the code needs a fix, open another release PR with a new version instead.

## Security

Use the [private reporting process](SECURITY.md) for vulnerabilities. Do not put exploit details or credentials in a public issue.
